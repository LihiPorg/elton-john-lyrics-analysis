    "lyrics": "You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate\nThe winter of your discontent came twenty years too late\nIf it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives\nWe both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge\nYou came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing\nReaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing\nI saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs\nLike Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air\nYea I've seen your movie\nAnd I read it in your book\nThe truth just flew off every page\nYour songs have all the hooks\nYou're seven wonders rolled in one\nYou shifted gear to cruise\nOh you came to town in headlines\nAnd eight hundred dollar shoes\nOh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands\nYour cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land\nThe marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast\nYour being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass\nOh you came to town in headlines\nAnd eight hundred dollar shoes"

    "lyrics": "Eminem lives, sleeps and breathes music — he's a bit like me in that respect. He's pretty much a recluse. I think he's enthralled with what he's doing; he's intimately involved with his art. There's a mystique about him. From the start, I have always admired Eminem's thinking. That's the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked, despite all the nonsense talked about his being homophobic and crap like that. The Boy Georges of the world all got up in a twist about it. If they didn't have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem.\nEminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. That's very necessary today, when irony is becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just aren't many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome."
